You cannot just import a library

if there is no library then you must create one and then choose the path where is your library
There is no library format therefore you must click on the table that has been saved.

If your library consisted of more tables SAS will import them automatically whenever you import just one of them

You cannot save a library just the datasets therefore whenever you save you will only get datasets and no real libraries
