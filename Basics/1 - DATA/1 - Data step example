DATA test;
  set = mylibrary.mytable;
  where id=100;
RUN;

this will create a sas dataset called test from the table called 'mytable' that is available in the library 
'mylibrary'

You can also put conditions as 'where' as in sql

therefore this code will extract all the data from the table where id=100
