when you send a command withotu a 'create table' you will get an output tha may be a list or an html.

with the ods close command you can "close" the output destination this means 
that you can prevent SAS to continue to print in the same output file 
in this case the destination output is 'html' but can also be 'listing'

ods html; close;
ods html;

with the second command you will open another "flow" 

doing this will print your results in another html file
