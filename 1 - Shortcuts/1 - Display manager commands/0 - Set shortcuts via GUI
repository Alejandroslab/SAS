You can also set viewing the list of shortcuts

If you do not have changed your shortcut yet press F9
or type in the command bar: 'keys' without quotes

You will see the list of commands

You can just erase the commands as you like and change it
(but you cannot copy and paste )
also duplicates commands are allowed!

the only limit is that the most common shortcuts will not work as are Windows reserverd.
This means that you may want to choose strange keys like F6 or ctrl +f6
or F12 (and not F1, F2, shift+f2, etc....)

To save your setting you do not even need to close the keys window!
