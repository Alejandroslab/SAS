You can use the dm statement 

dm "keydef F12 'cle log; cle output; submit'";

RUn this on Sas editor (locally not remotely)

This will set the shortuct between quote '' with the key 'F12'

You can set any particular shortcut with commands. The only limit is that you must set a shortcut not very common like F1, F2,or shift + f2 etc as these are usually reserved to the OS and SAS will not run them

It is always better to inlcude the double quotes inside the single quotes as we may have nested commands:

dm 'post "this is a message"';

and as this command will not work:

dm "post "this is a message"";


As we may need to nest other quotes it is better that the first dm command wil run with single quotes ''
