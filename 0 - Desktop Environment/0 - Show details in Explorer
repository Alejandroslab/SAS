In Explorer you can set your settings in order to see quickly the detail in
the detail view under the column 'Dimensions'

you will see the size and the n. of columns and rows.

CAAREFUL: this is not good when you need to explore libraries with a lot of tables as this will take time to load (maybe it is useful just for the temporary folders: work and rwork)


you can also use in code:

dm "next explorer; detail";
