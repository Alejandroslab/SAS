/*As we know this proc will retrieve a lot of info about ALL the tables of ALL the libraries.*/

PROC SQL;
SELECT *
FROM DICTIONARY.TABLES;
QUIT;

The column names that appear are practically labels. We need the real name to use it in order to select just the ones we need.

to do that run these 2 lines:

proc sql;
describe table dictionary.tables;

as we need the name of the library(libname), the name of the table (memname) and the number of observations (aka 'nobs') we will use:

PROC SQL;
SELECT libname, memname, nobs
FROM DICTIONARY.TABLES;
QUIT;
