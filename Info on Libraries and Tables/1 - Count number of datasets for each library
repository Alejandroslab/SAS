/*just use the dictionary.tables*/

PROC SQL;
SELECT libname, count(memname)
FROM DICTIONARY.TABLES
group by libname;
QUIT;


then you can also refine it adding the size in megabytes and the column labes:

PROC SQL;
SELECT libname, count(memname) as Number_of_Tables, round(sum(filesize)/1000000, 0.1) as Sum_of_Table_Sizes_in_MB
FROM DICTIONARY.TABLES
group by libname;
QUIT;
